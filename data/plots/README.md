Plots of cell power by ratio for each segment. 
   msk--> 
     referenced --> This plots show how signal changes before smoothing
       byCell --> Facets classify segment by NetworkGen-NetworkType-LAC-CID
       byUsers --> Facets classify segment by Users
     smoothed --> This plots show how signal changes after smoothing. Signals classified by 
     NetworkGen-NetworkType-LAC-CID : quality,
     where quality is statistical parameter of smoothing R^2
